# Hyper-heuristics with Path Relinking as post optimization for the GTD-ATSP-TW in Air Travel

- Problem description and instances from the Travelling Salesman Challenge 2.0 from kiwi.com in 2018.
- The problem is modeled as a Generalised Time-Dependent Asymmetric Travelling Salesman Problem with Time Windows.
- It is proposed the use of Path Relinking within a Hyper-heuristic framework to solve the problem.
